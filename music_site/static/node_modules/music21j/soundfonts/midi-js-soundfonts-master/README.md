# midicube/MIDI.js Soundfonts (Reduced!)

This is a fork of [Gleitz's MIDI.js Soundfonts](https://github.com/gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts) which is an
amazing resource that collects lots of soundfonts and is amazing!  Look at it!

However, it is very big to install inside another package.  This package exists to give primarily orchestral
instruments in pretty high quality for use in other packages, such as
[music21j](https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21j), trying to keep the install to around 80MB as opposed
to the 4GB+ of the Gleitz collection.

Note that the .ogg files are much higher quality and are used by every browser except Safari which
does not have .ogg support.  The mp3 versions are slowly being replaced by higher quality versions
that are not exact matches but avoid the huge overtone problems found in the original versions.
